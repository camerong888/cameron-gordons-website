        <p className="elevator-pitch">
          Passionate Electrical and Computer Engineer with a Master's from Northeastern University. Specializing in innovative hardware and software solutions, with proven expertise in embedded systems, PCB design, and hardware validation. Currently driving cutting-edge projects at Raytheon, following impactful internships at Tesla, Redwire Space, and more.
        </p>

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>
          At Redwire Space, I led the hardware and software design for a new sun sensor product, achieving a 70% cost reduction while maintaining top performance. I developed mathematical models and optimization algorithms that boosted sensor accuracy by 250% and cut manufacturing time by 15%. Working with cross-functional teams, I delivered a prototype ahead of schedule, projecting a 450% ROI in the first year.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my internship at Tesla, I redesigned integrated circuits for display interface PCBAs in mass-production vehicles, reducing costs by over 15% and enhancing thermal management and signal integrity. I resolved critical design flaws, collaborated with global vendors, and optimized production validation for greater efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional hands-on experience includes roles at Fresenius Medical Care and Liberty Defense, where I honed skills in hardware validation and embedded systems across 21 months of industry exposure.
        </p>

        <h2>Academic & Extracurricular Achievements</h2>
        <p>
          As Project Lead for Northeastern Electric Racing, I guided a team of eight through three major hardware and software projects for a Formula SAE electric vehicle. Our efforts culminated in 1st Place Electric Vehicle at the IEEE-sponsored Formula Hybrid+Electric 2021 Competition.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Recently completed the SUMMIT SIGNALâ€”an IoT satellite-based SOS device with AWS connectivity. This handheld innovation features GNSS and Iridium antennas, IMU, MCU, gate driver, Li-Ion charger, and power multiplexer for reliable global emergency communication.
        </p>

        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
        <p>
          Eager to tackle new challenges in hardware engineering, I seek opportunities to innovate and impact lives through technology. Committed to lifelong learning in a dynamic field.
